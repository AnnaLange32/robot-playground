These images are based on the images in Imagesv2, but bipolarised with 70x70 pixels. I think it is best to alreadz use these in the training and also show them during game play. It might reduce the noise as the pxel format already matched the one accepted by the Hopfield Net. The pixels can be changed via the variable rsize, however (70,70) gave good recognition results (good enough resolution) whilst still running reasonaly fast.
